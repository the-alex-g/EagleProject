# Alex Gestwicki's Eagle Project

Welcome to GitHub! In case you're not familiar, GitHub is a version control system that allows the user to back up their work on _The Web._
Using version control also lets you revert to previous iterations of your project, in case you messed something up and need to reset.

Above, you should be able to see a bunch of folders and files. You can navigate through them and download the ones you need.

All the images are in PNG and SVG formats, for use in the documents and for editing in Inkscape, respectively. They can be found in the
"Diagrams" and "Glossary" folders.
